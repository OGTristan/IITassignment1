      <h1>Personal Information</h1>

    <div class="sectionContent">
      <p>G’day! My name is Tristan Frank. I’m 19, I graduated from St Michael's Grammar School in 2020, and am now enrolled in a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My background is pretty interesting; Mum’s side of the family is English, Irish, Scottish and,
        primarily, Convict Aussie (my great-great-something grandpa stole a sheep & was sent to Australia on a prison ship), and Dad’s side is German. So pretty much, I’m German and convict Aussie :)
        I have a pet dog named Harry, and a younger sister called Zoe (I’m not sure which one I like more). I also played A grade tennis, where I won 2 grand finals before stopping due to COVID in year 12.
        Furthermore, I’m also a big fan of AFL, F1 and Soccer, where I support the Sydney Swans, McLaren and Chelsea/Melbourne Victory respectively. </p>

      <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="sectionContent">
      <p>My interest in IT mainly comes from gaming, with my passion for games stemming from playing Club Penguin when it first launched in 2006. Throughout primary school, I would always get home & play Call of Duty, Minecraft and Pirates of the Caribbean Online with my friends.
         I remember having so much fun in my early days of gaming, and with games only getting better & more advanced as time went on, my passion grew with it. At the end of 2020 I built my first proper gaming PC, which was a very stressful yet exciting project that introduced me
         to a whole new area of IT. Ever since, I’ve yearned to learn more about the world of IT and how it all works, which is why I’m studying now studying Information Technology.

         Before enrolling at RMIT, I was studying Business at Monash, but I deferred early on as I realised that it wasn’t the right course for me. I spent the rest of 2021 working & planning a gap year holiday (which unfortunately didn’t come into fruition due to covid), as
         well as thinking about what I actually wanted to study. After a considerable amount of thinking, I realised that studying IT made the most sense, as it’s something I’ve always liked but never really considered as a future career path.
         After looking at a few Bachelor of Information Technology degrees from different universities, the RMIT course looked to be the best suited for what I wanted to learn, hence why I’m studying here in 2022 :)

         Aside from gaming, my knowledge in IT is minimal, thus it’s difficult to specifically state what I want to learn during my time at RMIT. I chose to study here to learn as much as possible about the different areas of IT & coding, since I find technology fascinating and
         want to expand my knowledge of the subject as much as I can. I’d specifically like to learn how to write code & build websites, since the idea of Web Design & development appeals to me the most</p>

         <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
       </div>

       <div class="sectionContent">
         <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
         <p>My ideal job is a front end developer. Front end developers are tasked with building & designing the visual elements of a website that the end user can see and interact with. This role is particularly appealing to me because as a front end developer, I would have direct creative input on the design & layout of a website. As a junior developer, I would get to work alongside other seasoned developers, who can share their experiences & knowledge in the field, thus giving me the appropriate training & skills to go on to become a proper front end developer.

The job ad I found as a front end developer requires a number of skills & responsibilities. As a junior front end developer, you are expected to have “proficient skills in web languages such as CSS, JavaScript and HTML, with 2 years of experience required.” They are also expected to know CMS, Google APIs, rendering quirks and have an understanding of cross-browser compatibility. They are also responsible for formatting FAQs, updating, maintaining & managing websites, code evaluation and completing ad-hoc projects assigned from other senior developers at the company.

As previously stated, I have very little understanding of these areas yet, so I’d have to learn all of these skills from scratch if I wanted to pursue this job. However, I’m eager & willing to learn more about these areas of IT, plus I’m ready to expand my knowledge, so I can fulfil these job requirements in future.

I’m hoping that through this course I can develop an understanding for the basics, such as HTML & other web languages, and further enrich my skills in later years of the course.</p>

    <h1>Personality Profiles></h1>
    <img src="test 1.png" alt="Myers-Briggs results" />
  </div>

  <div class="sectionContent">
    <article>
      <h2>Test 1: Myers-Briggs</h2>
      <p>I am an ENFP-T Campaigner, with the role of Diplomat and strategy of Social Engagement. I interprit this to mean that I am an outgoing, open-minded, sociable person, who acts more on feeling than rational thinking. Likewise, I tent to be flexible & intuitive in regard to decision making, however I am sensitive to stress due to my drive for improvement.</p1>
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p>Curiosity & perceptiveness were two of my high ranking strengths, indicating that I am imaginative & open-minded when experiencing new ideas, and ready to ask questions when I’m learning something new. I’m enthusiastic when engrossed in a subject I enjoy, which combined with my traits of festiveness & good nature suggests that I get along with pretty much anyone, which can lead to some deep, meaningful conversations.</p>
        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>One of the downsides of my extraverted nature is that I am uncomfortable with the thought of being disliked. I like to maintain the peace with people, and it can get to me when I fail to win someone over. I also struggle with organisation & focus, tending to postpone dull & strenuous tasks in favour of others that seem more appealing at the time, which can lead to increased stress & anxiety due when completing these later due to my emotional nature</p>
        <h3>Team Composition</h3>
        <p>While I may not be as organised or focused as other team members, my outgoing personality indicates that I can work well in a team. I find it easy to strike up conversations & make friends, and am ready to resolve any conflicts that may arise, meaning that I can fit into almost any team & feel comfortable in my work environment. I may struggle to stay committed when completing a large task, but my communication skills & curious nature allow me to ask for help when I’m struggling, and my drive for improvement leaves me open to new ideas on how I can improve my work & achieve the best possible result for the team.</p>

      <h2>Test 2: Learning Styles Test</h2>
      <p>In my learning styles quiz, I scored highly in the Reflector learning style, with Pragmatist and Activist styles tying for equal second. This suggests that I am mainly an observant learner, who takes their time to collect as much information about a topic as possible before feeling confident about developing & finalising my work. I also benefit from being a pragmatist, which involves applying knowledge into practical scenarios, such as case studies and discussions, as well as an Activist, with my open-mindedness allowing me to immerse myself in new experiences through brainstorming and problem setting.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h2>Test 3: Big 5 Personality Factors</h2>
      <p>My personality trait test saw high scores in Agreeableness, Neuroticism and Openness, with lower results in Extraversion and Conscientiousness. This suggests that I am likely to put the needs of others before the needs of myself, indicating that I am cooperative and empathetic. This along with my Openness allows me to approach challenges from a more abstract, creative point of view, rather than conventional, practical means. However, my high Neuroticism suggests that I am more prone to experience negative emotions like anxiety, guilt and shame, leading to me easily feeling overwhelmed if I am struggling to understand or finish a task. I’m not sure why I scored a low extraversion score on this test in comparison to my other two tests, but my low Conscientiousness score implies that I tend to seek out short-term pleasure instead of long term success, due to a lower level of self-discipline and order when setting out to complete a task.</p>

    <h1>Project Idea: MusicHub</h1>
  </div>

<div class="sectionContent">
<article>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>My project idea is MusicHub: an all-new social media platform designed for sharing & discovering new music with your friends. MusicHub allows you to share songs that you like, see what music your mates are listening to, browse popular charts & genres, and get listening reports with recommended songs based on your music tastes. Users can post snippets of their favourite songs, with the option of listening to the full track if you’re really digging the vibe.
MusicHub uses Apple Music, Spotify and YouTube music integration to track your listening history, and add new songs directly to your playlists through the app, and can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play shop.</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>Have you ever found a new song that you absolutely love? One that you hear and straight away think ‘Oh my god, I need to show this to everyone?” You COULD post it on your Instagram or Snapchat, but you don’t want to be ‘that guy’ who posts music on their story; nobody’s going to listen to it. So, what if there was an app specifically designed to share songs you’re obsessed with AND discover some new bangers AT THE SAME TIME?

That’s the motivation behind MusicHub.

In 2021, over 487 million people used music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, with this figure set to increase in the coming years. There are also over 1 billion Instagram and monthly users. MusicHub would combine both of the social media & music streaming elements into 1 app, incorporating these 2 different areas for the first time & tapping into a relatively untouched area of the market.</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Description<h2>
  <p>MusicHub would feature a scroll-based design, much like Instagram, to view posts from other users. When creating a post, the user can choose a 30-second snippet from any part of the song that they like the most to share on their feed. This snippet will be what plays for other users when they tap on the post. While viewing their feed, users have the options to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Like the post, (similar to liking a photo on Instagram) which displays a public like next to the song for other users & the original poster to see.</li>
    <li>Listen to the song in its entirety, either through the MusicHub app or through the user’s default music streaming platform.</li>
    <li>Add the song to their playlist, either on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music or a MusicHub ‘liked songs’ playlist.</li>
    <li>A ‘Not my vibe’ button, for if you dislike the song. This adjusts your feed & removes similar music, such as other songs shared by the same user, the genre of the song & the artist. </li>
    <li>A ‘Repost’ button (similar to retweeting on Twitter), which reposts the snippet on your feed for your followers to see.</li>
    <li>A ‘Comment’ button, allowing users to leave their opinions & comments about the track. These comments can be read by the original poster and other users, with the option for them to reply to or like/dislike the message</li>
  </ul>
  <p>MusicHub would feature 3 main feeds: Friends, Trending and Related.
The ‘Friends’ feed will show snippets posted by your friends & users that you follow. This is the core feature of the app, allowing you to see what tracks your mates are currently obsessed with & share new music with your social group.
The ‘Trending’ tab will show songs that are currently charting on the app. Songs that receive the most likes from across the app, or big new releases from major artists, will appear on this feed.
The ‘Related’ tab will show new songs based on your like activity, as well as artists that you follow on the app. This tab would also use your listening history to see what genres & artists you listen to the most, and recommend new songs based on the user’s listening activity.


MusicHub would ideally use integration for Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube Music to track what music you’ve been listening too and add it to your profile. These listening reports can be displayed publicly, or kept private.
This integration would also allow MusicHub users to find & add friends from their streaming platforms.

Additionally, there will be a ‘Search’ tab, so users can look for the usernames of their friends & other users, as well as other songs, snippets & artists on the app.

MusicHub will also feature a ‘pause’ option, which stops the app from tracking your listening history on other music streaming apps for a set period of time (e.g. 3 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days) or until turned back on again.

Another important feature (that I personally think should be more widespread in the world of social media) is that user data WILL NOT be sold to external advertising agencies & 3rd parties.</p>

<h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
<p>To be completely honest, I don’t fully understand how this technology works, so I want to keep it a bit basic in order to keep this idea feasible. The layout for the app would be designed in an app-creating software like Quixy, incorporating HTML programming features to design the layout & interactive features of the app. MusicHub would track your public listening history on other streaming apps in order to generate a ‘Related’ feed for the user.</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>This app would require skills in both the front end and back end of developing.
For the front end, HTML will be used to design the layout & interactive elements of the app.
This app would also require a lot of back end development. Since MusicHub would require a lot of user data to operate functionally, an SQL server database would be needed to store & process information related to recommending songs & tracking listening history. This will need to be translated into a local, server-side language, such as Python, PHP or Go.
I am just starting to understand HTML, so there are a lot of skills I’d need to learn in order to get this app working.</p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>In order for this project to work, I’d need to perfect my HTML skills, as well as learn how to set up an SQL server and how to code in Python, PHP or Go. It’s a big task, but if complete, MusicHub would be the first app of its kind, combining music & social media into a whole new platform. To my knowledge, there are very few, if any, music sharing platforms that incorporate a focus on ‘social music,’ with most leaning towards providing a personalised music experience at the cost of social functionality. This app has the potential to tap into a whole new market, allowing for a new era of music sharing.</p>
