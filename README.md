<p> G’day! My name is Tristan Frank. I’m 19 and I graduated from St Michaels Grammar School in 2020, and am now enrolled in a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My background is pretty interesting; Mum’s side of the family is primarily English, Irish and Scottish, but my great-great(etc.) grandpa stole a sheep, and ended up on a convict ship bound for Australia.  My grandparents on Dad’s side are German, with my Opa (insert something about the royal family here). Oma and Opa lived in Palestine, but following the outbreak of WWII, had to flee back to Germany. My grandpa was conscripted into the German army and forced to fight in Africa, where he was taken as a prisoner of war for 3 years. After the war, he, my Oma and my infant uncle migrated to Australia, where my dad was born.
